# weather-forecast

Predicting weather using machine learning by implementing a ridge recession algorithm in python/jupyter notebook. Data is from https://toronto.weatherstats.ca.

Future:
- Find bigger dataset -> current one only spans from 2021 to 2024.
- Maybe create an app/website that shows prediction of the weather and suggests what clothes to wear

Trying to get better at machine learning algos -> maybe win kaggle contest?? ;)))
